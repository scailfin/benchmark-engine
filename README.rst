About
=====

The **Reproducible Benchmarks Engine** is a component of the *Reproducible Open Benchmarks for Data Analysis Platform (ROB)*. The benchmark engine is responsible for maintaining benchmark templates and benchmark runs. The results for all benchmark runs are integrated by the engine to compile a leaderboard for each benchmark.

**Note**: This repository is discontinued. It has been replaced by the core package for the `Reproducible Open Benchmarks for Data Analysis Platform (ROB) <https://github.com/scailfin/rob-core>`_.
